                            <span class="text_color_line">Macro-Nutrients: </span>
                            They are complex form of nutrients that human body reqiues in large
                            quantity in order to survive. They consist of mainly three types - <span class="text_color">Carbohydrates </span>,
                            <span class="text_color">Protein</span>, and <span class="text_color">Fats</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li> <span class="text_color">Carbohydrates:</span> They can be chemically termed as compound form of Carbon ,
                                     Hydrogen and Oxygen which are used as source of energy by human body 
                                     upon breakdown into glucose, simplest form of sugar. In simple terms, 
                                     they give us most of energy throughout the day to keep our body running 
                                     and make us active. The energy produced by Carbohydrates is 4 calories 
                                     per gram </li>
                                <li> <span class="text_color">Protein:</span>
                                    It is the most fundamental nutrient that our body requires to grow. It is found
                                     in muscle, bone, skin, hair and in virtually every part of our body. 
                                     Therefore, it is responsible for the growth of our muscles, hair and
                                      maintenance of skin and bones. The energy produced by Protein is also 4 
                                      calories per gram.
                                    </li>
                                <li> <span class="text_color">Fats: </span>
                                    There is a general misconception among many people minds’ that Fat is bad 
                                    for our health. However, a healthy layer of fat surrounds our vital organs 
                                    such as heart, brain, lungs, kidney, and liver. In short, we can not even
                                    live without healthy fats. They can also prevent colon cancer, prostate 
                                    cancer, and breast cancer. It is important to understand that healthy intake 
                                    of fats is necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The energy produced by
                                    Fats is 8 calories per 1 gram.
                                    </li>
                                
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><span class="text_color_line">Micro-Nutrients:</span>
                            Human body do not require large intake of Micro-Nutrients like Macro-Nutrients that 
                            is why they are termed as ‘Micro-’. These nutrients mainly consist of Vitamins and 
                            Minerals and they are required to be taken from outside sources because human body 
                            do not produce these nutrients, therefore, they are also called as essential nutrients.
                            They are vital for brain development and immune function of our body.
